## Message to Hiring Manager
As a career-changer from public school teaching, I am excited about the digital-by-design expectations of working at Shopify. I love that Shopify values its Shopifolk for all our diverse characteristics, and its strong interest in individuals' career growth. The Shopify Internship experience would be an amazing opportunity to quickly establish myself in this new field by giving me a chance to show that I am a hard worker and a quick learner. I think my previous career experience as a classroom teacher demonstrates very strong soft skills - now I just need a chance to build on the hard skills I am currently learning in my DS certificate program by taking on real projects.

## If you were to open a Shopify store, what would you sell and why (or tell us about your store if you have one!) (200 word limit)
If I were to open a Shopify store, I would sell physical and digital products for helping parents better organize their lives, with the goal of people being able to parent to their fullest potential while minimizing stress and maximizing calmness and contentedness in their families. This would include digital downloads of products such as scheduling/time management resources and meal planning guides, as well as physical products such as personalized labels, bins, etc. to help with home organization.

## Any last thoughts? (ie. proud accomplishments, cool ideas, a joke, any links) (200 word limit)
My proudest accomplishment of the last year is being brave enough to walk away from my previous career in teaching high school science and take a leap for the unknown. I have loved the learning and new knowledge I am acquiring in my [Data Science certificate program](https://www.entityacademy.com/data-science-virtual-academy), and I'm excited to get established in the field. The final results are still pending (this application is a big step!), but I am very proud of myself for having the courage to try something new when the extreme stress and expectations of the teaching profession were clearly not sustainable for me and the life I want to create for myself.
